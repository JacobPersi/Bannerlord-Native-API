## M&B 2: Manged/Native Interface
This project aims to intercept the Managed (C#) â†” Native (C++) interface for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, allowing you to interact with the game in ways outside the standard modding API.

- See [Interfaces](Interfaces/Interfaces.md) for outbound calls from managed to native.
- See [Events](Events/Events.md) for inbound calls from native to managed.

### NativeManager.cs
`NativeManager` is a helper class for interacting with the native interface. In order for the generated APIs/Events to work, you need to run the `CollectReferences` method ahead of time. This collects the native references into dictionaries used by the generated code.  

### CodeGen.cs
`CodeGen` generates wrapper code around the native interfaces to enhance the ease of modding. Code within `Events` & `Interfaces` is auto generated.
